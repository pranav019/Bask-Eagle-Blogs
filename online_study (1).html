                             <p>The COVID-19 pandemic took the world by
                                    surprise.
                                
                                        Globally, everything has stopped. Projects have been delayed, workplaces closed
                                        and schools shut down. The world seems to have ground to a halt because of the
                                        novel coronavirus.
                                    
                                    
                                            However, students continue their education through online learning and via
                                            video calls with their teachers, especially in big cities such as Jakarta.
                                            The model is currently the best alternative as keeping schools open poses a
                                            safety risk for students.
                              </p> 
                              <p>Many educational institutions were unprepared for the switch to online learning. Also, many struggled to provide the same quality of teaching, especially during the first weeks of lockdown.

Moreover, students from disadvantaged backgrounds found it hard to keep up with their virtual classmates. Some did not have regular access to a laptop or tablet, while many others had limited (or non-existent) WiFi connections.

Thankfully, administrators responded effectively to these new challenges. In New Orleans, USA, School Superintendent Henderson Lewis Jr oversaw the purchase of 8,000 WIFI hotspots, with another 6,000 on the way over the next few months. Public subsidiaries are also helping students get their own laptops and internet-enabled devices.</p>
                              <p>While online learning has been on the rise for some time, the range of study options is still relatively limited. In France, only around 10% of higher education courses were accessible online before the pandemic. The number has risen since, although most courses tend to focus on skills for white-collar jobs. As a result, students interested in more practical professions, such as carpentry or mechanical repair, have fewer options. So, they have to put their career plans on hold for the next period of time.

Also some students compromise by selecting less suitable programmes, fearing that if they postpone their studies, they will be left behind in a highly competitive job market.

In other words, there's still lots of work to be done before online learning becomes genuinely inclusive. Broadening the range of online courses on offer is essential, if online learning is to fulfill its potential.

There are reasons for optimism, though. Advances in robotics, virtual reality, and augmented reality could soon help students learn hands-on skills without stepping foot inside a workshop or laboratory. Companies such as Diverse Interactive have already developed VR training simulators for medical students and trainee surgeons.</p>

                                 <p>    
                                            Globally, many countries have adopted this approach. Schools in New York,
                                            the United States, prepared for online learning by distributing gadgets to
                                            their students, ensuring they had access to learning materials. As of early
                                            April, education authorities distributed around 500,000 laptops and tablets
                                            to their students, allowing them to participate in classes online.
                                        
                                
                                When the first two COVID-19 cases were announced in Indonesia in early March, the
                                country was in a panic. On March 14, Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan announced that all
                                schools in Jakarta were to be closed. However, many schools were not ready to apply home
                                learning programs yet. The online classes implemented in Indonesia work differently from
                                those in the US. This is due to a lack of preparation in this country.
                                
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                As a student participating in the home-learning program, online school was confusing to
                                adjust to as we had not been prepared through simulations or practices beforehand.
                                Students reported the home-learning program to be even more stressful than regular
                                classrooms. Some of the common reasons for this went along the lines of: "Normal classes
                                may have been difficult, but having friends makes it so much more manageable and less
                                stressful. Online classes take out the benefits of having friends to socialize with and
                                being stuck alone with nothing but assignments."
                                
                                  
                                
                                    Many students participating in home-learning programs also say that the workload of
                                    online classes is larger than that of regular classes. The general consensus is that
                                    home-learning programs — although highly beneficial and a good alternative to school
                                    as schools are closed — still require some getting used to by students, as it is a
                                    novel concept and not many are experienced with them.
                                </p> 

                                
                                <p>   

                                    However, although the closing of schools does have a silver lining (home-learning
                                    programs where students are still able to learn), the true sufferers of the
                                    government order of school closings are the students in less fortunate situations
                                    and the students who are in schools that are not well-funded.



                                    This leaves many students in a bad spot where they are unable to receive an
                                    education. Although internet service providers have been giving out free data
                                    packages, they are simply not capable of supporting video calls on programs such as
                                    Zoom.
                               

                                    The presence of COVID-19 will directly and permanently change education in the
                                    future, seeing that we must be able to adapt to working and studying online for any
                                    kind of reasons and situations. I believe, both TVRI’s Belajar di Rumah program and
                                    the Guru Berbagi platform will leave a legacy and should be continued to support
                                    class teachings for good.

                                    Only time will tell whether online classes will be a good substitute for normal
                                    classes, and if they are, there will be a rise in online educational programs and
                                    online universities. (kes)
